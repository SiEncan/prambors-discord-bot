# 🎵 Prambors Discord Bot

Prambors Discord Bot is a **Discord bot** that allows users to listen to **Radio Prambors Jakarta 102.2FM** directly from Discord without opening a browser tab.  

This project is one of my **earliest coding projects** and played a major role in keeping me active in programming.

## ✨ Background Story

I first created this bot in **2018**, when I was in **9th grade (Junior High School)**.  

At that time, I wanted to **bring Radio Prambors from the website to Discord** because opening a Chrome tab to listen to the radio was **too heavy on my PC**, especially when I was gaming.  

The code might look simple now—but remember, it was written by a middle schooler **learning only from StackOverflow and YouTube tutorials**.  

Initially, this bot was **for personal use** with my friends in a private Discord server. However, it quickly gained interest and eventually:

- 📌 Deployed in **1,118 Discord servers**  
- 👥 Used by **447,000 Discord users** across all servers
